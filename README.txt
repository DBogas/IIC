This is the README file for this project.

(1st of February 2019, edit)
ATTENTION:
The language used in development was java!
Github says javascript because i generated tousands of json objects, which count as javascript code.

I aim to study the physical components of the STCP Bus and Tram Network.
Both Day and Night networks were studied together.

The AllStops.txt is a .txt file that contains all the stops, this avoids my IP getiing blocked and takes less than connecting to a site 
everytime i want to test.

The AllLines.txt file does the same for the lines, for the same reasons.

There are readers for these files.

There are also .csv files for gephi usage, these are alse generated with java.

.csv files exist for no grouping, grouping by street and by code.

Results obtained from using this project, should be viewed through Gephy, assuming this still works.
